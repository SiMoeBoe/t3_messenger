[https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/messenger.html](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/messenger.html)

## Integration guide

The extension basically provides the same functionality as if you would use the messenger in the Symfony Framework.
In order to configure the messenger you have to put a Messenger.php file under the Configuration of an extension.

```php

return [

];

```
